...Is a trivial url-saving scratchpad.

It's good for taking quick notes and scrawling notes while on the browser. It simple uses a contenteditable body and stores directly on the url via parameters, and as such works complete offline once loaded and persists across reloads. It's meant to stay as simple as possible.
